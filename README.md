# pybot-base
A skeleton for a Telegram based bot, written in Python 2.

## quick start
Provide a Telegram API key as an env variable (`TELEGRAM_APIKEY`) or as the command line argument:
```bash
$ export TELEGRAM_APIKEY = 123456:ABCDEFG0123456789
$ python start.py
```
```bash
$ python start.py 123456:ABCDEFG0123456789
```
When running, this bot will always answer "Hi! I'm a bot."
Please fork this repo and personalize how the bot will answer; just have a look at the Telegram API: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api.
